# Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.hsplatform}}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} {{site.data.keyword.hsplatform}} (*{{site.data.keyword.hsplatform}}* for short) ensures that your iOS applications and data are in a highly-protected environment in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
{:shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.hsplatform}} offers you an iOS starter kit and a server-side starter kit in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, which both simplify your steps to set up a secure development environment. A starter kit provides you the development evironment with the development language, the framework, and the architecture pattern.
- iOS starter kits  
The **MBaas with IBM Hyper Protect Services** starter kit is an iOS starter kit that hosts Hyper Protect services for your application in a Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) platform.
- Server-side starter kit  
The **Backend for IBM Hyper Protect Services** starter kit is a server-side starter kit that hosts additional services for your application with a Backend For Frontend (BFF) architecture pattern. The BFF pattern can provide additional composition and control over the services and can add backend logic for the application.<!--For more information about the differences between MBaaS and BFF, see [MBaaS vs. Backend Components](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/swift/backend/mbaas.html){:new_window}.-->

When you start to develop your iOS applications with these starter kits, you can benefit from a set of Hyper Protect services, including {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Hyper Protect DBaaS, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}, and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.hscontainers}}.  {{site.data.keyword.hsplatform}} integrates these services and binds them together to protect not only your application, but also all your data at rest, in use, or in flight. For more information about these Hyper Protect services, see [About Hyper Protect services](/docs/hypersecure-platform?topic=hypersecure-platform-how-it-works).

## Deploying an application
{: #deploy}

The {{site.data.keyword.hsplatform}} starter kits enable you to deploy your application to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} through an easy-to-use UI.

Before you begin, you need to create a cluster with [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Kubernetes Service](/kubernetes/clusters){:new_window} as a worker node to host your application.

1. Open the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} dashboard](/resources){:new_window}<!--, click **Projects** in the left navigator-->.
2. Click and open your backend project, that is, **BackendforIBMHyperProtectServicesyyyyy**.
3. Click **Deploy to cloud**. Choose to deploy your application in a Kubernetes cluster. Choose the cluster that you want to use from the dropdown list. Click **Create**. The deployment creates a Git repository and stores your generated code. It also creates a DevOps toolchain that includes creating and managing issues in Git, viewing generated code in Git, accessing an Eclipse-base Web IDE, and viewing the delivery pipeline. In the delivery pipeline, you can kick off builds, manage deployment and view logs and history.
4. Click **View Toolchain** and click **Git**.
5. Push your application code to Git. You changes in Git automatically triggers build in the delivery pipeline. You can click **Delivery Pipeline** in Toolchain page to see the delivery status.

Now your application is successfully deployed to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}{:new_window}.

You can also use command line interfaces (CLIs) to deploy your applications to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. For more information, see [Deploying apps with the CLI](/docs/containers?topic=containers-app#app_cli){:new_window}.

After you deploy your application to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you will get an URL from the UI or CLI.  You can use this URL to access the backend server.
